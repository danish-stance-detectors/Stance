# Be aware of the following characteristics:
#
# There is one line for each sense of a word which means that for many words there are multiple lines.
# The list may contain multiword expressions, sometimes with parentheses, slashes, dots, etc. for denoting variation.
# As there is one line per sense a synonymic relation between A and B, and A and C, does not imply a synonymic relation
# between A and C, i.e. from ånd = geni and geni = genialitet, you cannot deduce genialitet = ånd. For the same reason
# (one sense per line), you cannot be sure that a synonym for a given word is correct in a given context.
